In this notebook we will try to make a model that analyise customer comments and classify them as "positive" or "negative".

  ### 1. Business often receive customers feedback on social network platforms like instagram, facebook etc without any ratings. It is hard for business to keep track of all the key responses and improve themselves. Hence it will be important for businesses to grade their customer responses.

  ### 2. To solve this problem we need data that contain customer responses along with their ratings.

  ### 3. In this notebook we will collect google reviews of various restaurants along with customers ratings to prepare our dataset

  ### 4. In our prepared dataset following thing we should take care
  - there should be proper balance between positive and negative class.
  - our dataset should not contain any null values and duplicate values.
  - customer comments should be cleaned if there is any special character or an emoji.
  - comments are to be converted in small case for consistency.
  - stemming applied on comments to improve model performance.
